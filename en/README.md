##Preface

This book is structured in short chapters where the structure of the Standard Template Library (STL) will be shown, presenting both design principles and actual implementation.<br>
Some fundamental concepts of C++, necessary to understand how the STL is built, will be briefly brushed up, but prior familiarity with the language is assumed, particularly regarding OOP, templates, management of pointers and references.<br>
Basic understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms is required.
